          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello and welcome to my blog!</p>
          <p>
            I'm Prasanna, a passionate coder with a love for solving problems
            and building innovative solutions. With a solid background in
            Computer Science, I’m currently on the lookout for exciting new
            opportunities where I can contribute my skills and grow
            professionally. When I’m not immersed in code, I cherish spending
            time with my wonderful family of four Whether it’s exploring new
            hobbies together, embarking on family adventures, or simply enjoying
            quality time at home, they are my greatest source of inspiration and
            joy. This blog is a space where I share my journey in the tech
            world, insights on coding, and occasionally, snippets of life with
            my family. I’m excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and
            anyone interested in the evolving landscape of technology. Thanks
            for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that resonates
            with you!

            Here is about my family. My husband, <i>Ram</i>,is working as a
            Storage engineer for a reputated consulting company. He has 15 years
            of solid technical experience in the infrasrtucture. My kids are
            <i>Rithika</i> and <i>Ridhvin</i>, also called as <i>Lucky</i> and
            <i>Ricky</i>. My Daughter is Studying 5th grade now in Hyderabad.
            She is very good at her studies and extra curricular activities as
            well. My Son is Studying 2nd grade in the same school where my
            daughter studies. He is energetic and happiest boy who admires me
            for everything with his cute gestures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from this I always love my extended family from my husband's
            side and my side like parents, in-laws, cousins, and siblings.
            Ofcourse parents are the foundation of my family, I always mind and
            take care of my parents and In-laws.

          <p>
            I have many friends until now, but I have to specially mention a
            family that lives in Oslo, Norway who are very kind and friendly
            towards me. We became friends in Oslo when we were staying there.
            Our friendship started in my daughter's school to make our kids to
            be friends but we became very close friends. After my family, It is
            a very healthy relationship in my life.

          <p>
            As part of my husband's long term assignment of his current working
            company we have been to Norway for almost 3 years. It was a great
            experience for me as I was always dreaming about to visit Kashmir to
            experience the snow, but I lived there for 3 winters in the coldest
            country. The Northern Lights are also a life time memory for me
            which I could experience multiple time in the city I was living. We
            have also been to few neighborhood countries like Denmark,
            Switzerland, France, Netharlands, Belgium and Italy. I'm grateful to
            experience the best tourist places in the world.

            Here I would like to share few pictures and a video from our trips.
